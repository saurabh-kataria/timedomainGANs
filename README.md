Code for training time-domain (1-D CNNs) for supervised (conditional GAN/CGAN) and unsupervised GANs (CycleGAN).

Training scripts:
1. local/train_GAN.py - Trains a CGAN
2. local/train_cycleGAN_parallel.py - Trains a CycleGAN
3. local/train_cycleGAN_parallel_jointCGAN.py - Train a joint CGAN and CycleGAN

Additional dependencies are required like Hyperion (https://github.com/hyperion-ml/hyperion).
